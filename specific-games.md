# Specific Games

## Space Quest 2

Issues:

- Restoring game at room 5 always puts ego near the airlock chamber (instead of where ego should be)
  - This is due to script.save and loading script not being implemented yet

Progress:

- print.at and text.screen not really working properly

- Need an inventory screen / parse inventory item names correctly
  - Just a text list of items
- Need to filter buttons by keywords
- Mouse control? Or virtual joystick control?
